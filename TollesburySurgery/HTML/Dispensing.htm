<h1>
    Dispensing</h1>
<p>
    Our dispensary is open during all our opening hours. By law, patients living within 1.6km
    of the surgery may <strong>not</strong> have their prescription dispensed by our pharmacy.
    If you have any queries about this, please ask at reception. <strong>Please give 48
        hours notice for a repeat prescription. Repeats ordered on a Friday will be ready
        for collection the following Tuesday.</strong> We do not take repeat prescriptions
    by telephone, except in extenuating circumstances. Requests for repeats may be brought
    to either the Tollesbury or Tolleshunt D'Arcy surgery, faxed on 01621-869023, or use our online system, as described below.</p>
    <p>
    The new online system will also allow you to request your prescriptions.
