<h1>GP Earnings</h1>
<p>
    The average pay for GP's working at Tollesbury Surgery in the last financial year before tax and national insurance is £72,273.
</p>
<p>
    This is for 2 full time GP's and 2 locum doctors who worked in the practice for more than 6 months.
</p>
<p>
    It should be noted that the prescribed method for calculating earnings is potentially misleading because it takes no account of how much time doctors spend working in the practice and should not be used to form a judgement about GP earnings, nor to make any comparison with any other practice.
