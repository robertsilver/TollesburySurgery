    Please give us two working days notice when requesting a repeat prescription. Try
    not to run out of your medication or demand a prescription immediately as this will
    often involve interrupting a doctor who might be seeing other patients. You can
    order your medication up to 14 days before it is due, to allow you to manage holiday
    periods only. Please put in the notes box to explain why you are ordering your medications
    early.

    The current system of allowing prescriptions to be emailed in to the surgery has
    now ended. Any prescriptions which are sent to our old email prescription service
    will not be processed.
