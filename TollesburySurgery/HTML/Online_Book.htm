    bookable. Anyone who turns up before 10.30am will be seen, but remember: these surgeries
    are very popular and sometimes there can be a wait. It does, however, mean that
    you can get to see a GP at short notice. The doors open at 8am with clinic starting
    at 9am.

    surgery by SMS text message to your mobile phone. This is to help patients remember
    and reduce the “Did not attend” appointments which are wasted. A confirmation text

    is sent 09:00 the day before your appointment.
