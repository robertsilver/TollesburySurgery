    Good patient experience is associated with improved patient outcomes. Various studies
    have shown positive associations between patient experience, patient safety and
    clinical effectiveness. It is therefore important that the NHS collects regular
    feedback from patients and takes action to address any areas of poor patient experience.
    The FFT is just one of a number of tools used in the NHS to collect feedback from
    patients. One of the key benefits of the FFT is that patients can give their feedback
    in near real time and the results are available to staff more quickly than traditional
    feedback methods. This enables staff to take swift and appropriate action should
    any areas of poor experience be identified. The results of the FFT are published
    on NHS Choices as they become available so that patients and members of the public
    can see how their local services are viewed by those who have used them. The results
    can provide a broad measure of patient experience that can be used alongside other
    data to inform patient choice.<br />
