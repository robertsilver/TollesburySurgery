    If you are on long term treatment, the doctor may agree to supply some of your repeat 
    prescriptions without seeing you. You will receive a computer printed slip showing details of 
    your medication. Tick the items required and post, fax or put it in the black ‘Repeat Prescriptions’ 
    box at the surgery. If you have multiple sheets, please ensure they are attached together. In the 
    interests of accuracy and safety we DO NOT accept requests over the telephone. Please allow two 
    working days for the preparation and signing of your prescription before collecting either the 
    prescription or your medicine. If you wish us to post your prescription, please attach a stamped, 
    addressed envelope

    Tollesbury Surgery has introduced a new repeat prescription service called Repeat Dispensing. It 
    allows the surgery to issue 6 separate monthly prescriptions at once, which means that the patient 
    does not have to request their medication from the surgery monthly. Patients will call at their chosen 
    pharmaecy. These prescriptions are usually kept at the Pharmacy where you would collect your 
    prescription from every month.
</p>
<p>

    This type of dispensing works very well with patients who have regular monthly prescriptions and 
    you have been identified as one on these patients. If you are interested in taking up this offer please 
    request for an application form the suurgery and return to the surgery before your next prescription 
    is due.

If you would like a little more information prior to completing the form please contact the surgery 
and speak to either Rohita the Practice Manager, or Denise Davidson.
