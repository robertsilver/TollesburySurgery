<h1>
    Travel Health</h1>
<p>
    A lot of travel related infections are preventable through understanding travel
    health issues and through travel immunisations. It is important to contact us as
    soon as possible following the booking of a holiday as some of the vaccine schedules
    can take several weeks to complete and sometimes we have to order in vaccines especially
    for you.</p>
<p>
    In order for our experienced nursing staff to advise you on what vaccines you might
    need, please either download and print off one of our risk assessment forms and
    hand it in at reception or alternatively. Please make sure you include your email
    address on the form so that we can email you back with specific travel information
    if it is required.</p>
<p>
    Please give us as much detail as possible so that the nursing team will be able
    to give you the best advice available. Once we have looked at your itinerary and
    the recommended immunisations, we will contact you either by email or telephone
    to advise you of the immunisation schedule(s) and any cost that might be incurred.
    We will advise you how long you need for your travel appointment and you will then
    be able to contact the surgery to book an appointment. Often, we will give you an
    initial appointment where we will administer the vaccines that are free on the NHS
    and discuss your thoughts on the ones that incur a fee. It would be useful for you
    to research the immunisations we offer you on the fit for travel website so that
    you can ask any questions you have at your appointment and then make an educated
    decision about whether you would like them.</p>

    Fit for travel</h2>
<p>
    Please familiarise yourself with this website: <a href="http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk"
        target="_blank">http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk</a></p>
<p>
    There is a lot of really useful information available for travellers on this website
    including country specific advice, general travel advice and information about specific
    diseases that occur in the different countries.</p>
<p>
    Please pay particular attention to the advice section where there is a lot of information
    covering the following topics “Advice for travellers”, “disease prevention” and
    “malaria”.</p>
<h2>
    Malaria</h2>
<p>
    Please have a look at the malaria map on the fit for travel website to identify
    if there is malaria in the areas you are travelling to. If the website advises antimalarial
    medications then please print off the malaria map and mark on it where you are going
    and bring it with you to your appointment so that we can decide together whether
    or not antimalarial medications are required for you. There is also information
    there about the different types of antimalarial medications available and it would
    be beneficial for you to familiarise yourself with these before you attend for your
    appointment.</p>
