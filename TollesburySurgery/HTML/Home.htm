<h2>
    Electronic Prescription Services</h2>
<div>
    The big prescription switchover is coming to Tollesbury Surgery on the 08.01.2014.<br />
    We are switching to the new NHS Electronic Prescription Service.
    <br />
    <br />
    What is the new NHS Electronic Prescription Service - it means that your doctor
    will no longer give you a paper prescription. Instead, an electronic prescription
    will go straight to the Pharmacy you choose. We want getting your prescription medicines
    to be as easy as possible, so to nominate the Pharmacy of your choose just speak
    to any member of Tollesbury Surgery Team or Pharmacy team today.
