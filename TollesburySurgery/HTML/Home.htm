                Tollesbury Surgery has made the difficult decision of suspending open/walk in surgery in the mornings, after advice from our peers and the CCG.
                <br /><br />
                If you need an appointment and it is not related to coronavirus please phone the surgery and make an appointment. The GP will triage and either phone you or ask you to come to the surgery.
                <br /><br />
                Thank you for your patience.

</article>
<article style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Flu (also known as influenza) is a highly infectious illness caused by the flu virus. It spreads rapidly through small droplets coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. For most people, flu is unpleasant but not serious. You will usually recover within a week.</p>
</article>
<article style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Studies have shown that flu vaccines provide effective protection against the flu, although protection may not be complete and may vary between people. Protection from the vaccine gradually decreases and flu strains change over time. Therefore, new vaccines are made each year and people at risk of flu are encouraged to be vaccinated every year.</p>
</article>
<article style="text-align: center;">
    <p>The flu vaccination is offered to people in at-risk groups. These people are at greater risk of developing serious complications if they catch flu, such as pregnant women and elderly people.</p>
