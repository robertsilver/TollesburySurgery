    their time to complete the questionnaire, by <a href="http://www.tollesburysurgery.co.uk/FileUploads/PatientSurvey.doc"
        target="_blank">clicking here</a>. We are trying to get a representative feedback

    Tollesbury Surgery recently carried out a <a href="http://www.tollesburysurgery.co.uk/FileUploads/Doctors_survey_Mar_2013.xlsx"
        target="_blank">survey</a> for 2 weeks, handing out the survey in the surgery
    reception, at the local chemist and via the surgery website, where patients were
    able to print the survey form and mail it back to the Surgery . The purpose of this
    survey is to receive feedback from as many patients as possible to improve the service
    at Tollesbury Surgery.
