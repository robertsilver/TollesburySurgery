</article>
<article style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Flu (also known as influenza) is a highly infectious illness caused by the flu virus. It spreads rapidly through small droplets coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person. For most people, flu is unpleasant but not serious. You will usually recover within a week.</p>
</article>
<article style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Studies have shown that flu vaccines provide effective protection against the flu, although protection may not be complete and may vary between people. Protection from the vaccine gradually decreases and flu strains change over time. Therefore, new vaccines are made each year and people at risk of flu are encouraged to be vaccinated every year.</p>
</article>
<article style="text-align: center;">
    <p>The flu vaccination is offered to people in at-risk groups. These people are at greater risk of developing serious complications if they catch flu, such as pregnant women and elderly people.</p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        We understand this is a worrying time for everyone, and there may be particular concerns for people who support someone living with dementia. The NHS in your area has been working with Essex County Council and other local organisations, including community and voluntary groups, to identify and reach out to people like you - people living with dementia and people who care for them.
    </section>
    <section style="margin-bottom: 15px;">By making welfare calls to you, we can find out more about your needs and help people to avoid reaching the point of crisis. The initial contact will come from the Alzheimer's Society through their Dementia Support Workers (who are professionally trained).</section>
    <section style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        They will ask how you are doing and discuss possible worries you have, for example:
        <ul>
            <li>The spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and how you can reduce the risk to you and others</li>
            <li>Getting access to food and medicine</li>
            <li>Seeking advice and help from your GP or pharmacy</li>
            <li>What happens if you or the person you support becomes unwell</li>
            <li>Making contact and staying in touch with family and friends</li>
            <li>Activities that you can do with your loved ones to take your minds off things</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section style="margin-bottom: 15px;">These calls will help the Dementia Support Workers to offer appropriate support or give you contact details of other organisations who can help you with your particular needs. We want you to know that the NHS and our partners are here for you and will help you get the support you need.</section>
    <section style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If you need more information or are worried about being contacted, especially in light of possible telephone scams, we are happy to clarify any doubts that you may have. You can contact us on <a href="meccg.dementiacovidcarersupport@nhs.net">meccg.dementiacovidcarersupport@nhs.net</a></section>
