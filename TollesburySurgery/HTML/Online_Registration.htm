<h1>
    Online Registration</h1>
<p>
    We're pleased to announce that we've updated our clinical systems to allow online
    appointments, however, you must have registered with the surgery. To register please
    visit the surgery with your <strong>photo Id</strong> and we'll provide you with
    a username and password.</p>
<p>
    If you can't visit the surgery, then write a letter of consent allowing a member
    of your family to visit the surgery on your behalf. Please advise the family member
    to bring in the <strong>consent letter</strong> and their <strong>photo Id</strong>
    with them.
