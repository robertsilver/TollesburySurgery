<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>The Practice abides by strict rules of confidentiality and care is taken in the transmission of sensitive data.</p>
 
<h2>How Do I Register?</h2>
<p>Providing you reside within our practice area, you can register with us.  It's easy!  Simply visit the surgery and complete a registration form for each new patient. On completion of the form, please allow 48 hours before requesting appointments. If you require emergency treatment, please speak to the receptionist. You will be asked to make a 'new patient check' (for adults and children over 14 only).  This is a 10 minute appointment with our nursing team to gather medical history and help you with any medical queries.</p>
 
<h2>Change My Details?</h2>
<p>It is very important that you notify us immediately of any changes of name, address or telephone number. There are many reasons why we may need to contact you.
If you change your name by marriage or Deed Poll we will require a copy of the documentation for our records.</p>
 
<h2>Temporary Residents</h2>
<p>We provide a temporary patient service for anyone staying within our practice area.  This could be whilst on holiday, staying with relatives etc.  Just call into the surgery, fill in one of our temporary resident forms and we will assist you.</p>
 
<h2>Appointment System</h2>
<p>All consultations are by appointment and should be made at reception or by telephone during opening hours.  Please book well in advance for routine appointments.</p>
 
<p>Antenatal, postnatal and surgical procedures need longer appointments. Do ask the receptionist if you are uncertain. Please wear loose clothing. Please inform reception if you would like a chaperone. </p>
 
<h2>Appointment booked on the day</h2>
<p>If you need to be seen on the day please attend our Open Clinic to see the doctor Monday – Friday  9.00-10.30am. Please note you are not able to book into Open Clinic by phone. The open Clinic is run on first come first seen system unless an emergency occurs then the doctor has to attend to the emergency.</p>
 
<h2>Phone In Times to speak with Doctors/ Nurses</h2>
<p>Please telephone before 11am when a receptionist will take your contact details and the doctor or nurse will return your call.</p>
 
<h2>Home Visits</h2>
<p>If you require a home visit please telephone the receptionist as early as possible, stating clearly the patient’s name, address and telephone number, the degree of urgency and the directions.   If your visit is accepted, a decision will be made as to which doctor visits; this may not be the doctor you are registered with.  Please note however, that home visits are extremely time-consuming so we would appreciate it if patients try as hard as possible to come to the surgery.</p>
 
<h2>Advice on Self Certification</h2>
<p>Any patient off sick from work for any length of time can self certify for the first seven calendar days.  Only after then will you require a medical certificate signed by your doctor.</p>
 
<h2>Zero Tolerance</h2>
<p>In line with NHS Guidelines we operate a policy of zero tolerance regarding physical or verbal abuse to the doctors, their staff or anyone else on the premises.  In the event of such behaviour the police will be called and arrangements will be made for that person/s to be removed from the premises and the practice list.</p>
 
<h2>Complaints Procedure</h2>
<p>The doctors and staff at Tollesbury Surgery endeavour to deliver high quality care. However, it may be that a patient feels he or she has a complaint. In these circumstances any such complaint will be fully investigated and to facilitate this we request that a note of the facts be submitted in writing to the practice manager, Grainne Donnelly or one of the doctors. Any such complaint should be made as soon as possible after the event. A copy of our complaints procedure is available on request from reception.</p>
