    <h3>
        Cervical Smears</h3>
    <p>
        If you are female and in the age group 25 - 49 it is recommended that you have a
        regular three-yearly smear test; for those aged 50 - 64, it is recommended that
        you have a test every five years. You will receive a recall letter generated by
        the Health Authority. This test makes it possible to detect and treat the early
        stages of abnormalities of the cervix before symptoms become apparent to you. The
        test is quick, simple and painless and usually performed by the nurse. Please ask
        at reception for details.</p>
